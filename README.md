This repository contains most of the code used for the Beach Boys Cover Database found at https://christophercook.me.uk/beachboys/

It does not include all the code base (some parts are left out for security sake), nor the database structure, nor the data.

This code makes use of jquery and the Stupid Table plugin (https://github.com/joequery/Stupid-Table-Plugin)

The responsive tables are based on the ideas found at https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/table-design-patterns-web and http://adrianroselli.com/2017/11/a-responsive-accessible-table.html
